## Project: StudyBananas

### Introduction
StudyBananas is a brown field team project for NUS CS2103T module - [software-engineering](https://nus-cs2103-ay1920s2.github.io/website/). 
Our team took over an existing project - [AddressBook3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/tp) and morphed it into a
**desktop flashcard study app**. StudyBananas is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** which is inherited 
from [AddressBook3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2021S1/tp), and was expanded to support many **GUI** features.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

###**Code contributed**

My code contribution can be viewed from [here](https://nus-cs2103-ay2021s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=chuyiting).

###**Enhancements implemented**

StudyBananas is composed of three main features, namely Schedule, Flashcards, and Quiz. Three features are designed individually first 
and start to integrate with each other in the later phase of the project. I was in charge of the Schedule feature along with my teammate
[Binh](https://github.com/ducbinh2611) in the first iteration of development. In the second iteration, I designed the UI structure for 
all three features to adopt and started to work on the integration of features in the last iteration. The below given lists the enhancements
implemented by me.
